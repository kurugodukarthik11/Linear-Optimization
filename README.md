# Linear-Optimization

## Question 1:

Implement Simplex algorithm with the following assumptions:

1. Polytope is bounded.
2. Polytope is non-degenerate.
3. Rank of A is `n`

Input: CSV file with `m+2` rows & `n+1` columns:

1. First row excluding the last element is the initial feasible point `X` of length `n`.
2. Second row excluding the last element is the cost vector `C` of length `n.
3. Last column excluding the top two elements is the constraint vector `B` of length `m`.
4. Rows 3 to `m+2` and columns 1 to `n` is the matrix `A` of size `m x n`.

Output: You need to print the sequence of vertices visited and the value of the objective function at that vertex.
